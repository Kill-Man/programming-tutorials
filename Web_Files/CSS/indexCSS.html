<!--In the HTML tutorial file (indexNoCSS.html), you will see that there are
	three types of CSS, inline, which belongs to a single tag, and all decendant
    tags, embedded, which is CSS in a document, but not belonging to any tag in
    particular, and external, which is CSS in a separate document. Inline and
    embedded CSS was used in indexNoCSS.html, this document will show you how
