<!-- We will use this HTML document to show examples of CSS syntax -->
<!--
    In the HTML tutorial file (indexNoCSS.html), you will see that there are
    three types of CSS, inline, which belongs to a single tag, and all
    descendant tags, embedded, which is CSS in a document, but not belonging to
    any tag in particular, and external, which is CSS in a separate document.
    Inline and embedded CSS was used in indexNoCSS.html, this document will show
    you how to use external CSS.
